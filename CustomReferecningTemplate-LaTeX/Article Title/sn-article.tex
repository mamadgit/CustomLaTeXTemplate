\abstract{In the context of multi-agent systems, formal modelling is considered a powerful method to capture an intrinsic representation of ``behaviour'' and ``belief'' in autonomous and intelligent agents. Various semantical models can be used to reason about agents' (state of) knowledge/beliefs to capture this representation. Many of these models often seek to enrich traditional (epistemic) models by computationally defining agents' reasoning processes, thereby incorporating computationally grounded criteria. However, by reviewing past research and analysing established semantics in theory and application, this paper will demonstrate that the concept of computationally grounded semantics is not fixed (i.e., criteria to be met), but rather exists on a continuum or a gradient. This is a significant notion to consider, as it suggests that the level of computational detail necessary to ground the design of a semantical model, so it may intrinsically represent agents' behaviour and beliefs, should be proportional to its environment. This means in certain environments, its even possible a more abstract and flexible design may be required. The relationship between the computational details of a semantical model and its environment is a topic that previous research has not thoroughly explored.\par
The current research landscape in formally modelling agent behaviour to create a computationally grounded semantical model has primarily involved either enhancing traditional epistemic models by including more computational details or developing entirely new types of formal models with different reasoning processes (such as temporal, stochastic, concurrent, etc., structures). According to those research, once specific criteria are satisfied, the semantics are deemed to be computationally grounded.\par
To elaborate on the importance of this perspective, this paper will present a semantical model known as concurrent game structures where the agents are resource-bounded as an example. While this model is considered an excellent example with solid computational details, this paper will argue that in the pursuit of computationally grounded semantics, one potential problem is that the model in a sense sacrifices the agents' autonomy. Such semantics makes it difficult to trace the reasoning process of any singular agent meaning an individual agent cannot explain its reasoning process. Hence, there is a need to consider proportionality when designing semantical structures and their environment. To that point, this paper will suggest a new route in which semantical models are computationally grounded (with relatively high level of computational details), but where autonomous agents can individually explain their reasoning process.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

The \emph{Belief-Desire-Intention} (BDI) framework with semantics based on possible worlds is prevalent and effective for reasoning about agent behaviour regarding the epistemic knowledge of autonomous and intelligent agents in multi-agent systems. Since it is somewhat difficult to determine how intelligent agents reason internally, the possible worlds semantics offers a solution by focusing on the agents' actions and its effects on the environment to explain the agents' reasoning process. The possible worlds semantics claims that an agent's knowledge state is determined by the states of the overall system and its environment, collectively referred to as global states (the technical definition of possible worlds semantics will be elaborated in section two). Much of the research regarding reasoning about agent behaviour has been centred around this framework and semantics \cite{10.1007/3-540-49057-4_1}. However, a significant problem that still lies around the BDI framework is the issue of agents being modelled as logically omniscient, which is not a realistic property as it suggests that an agent knows all the consequences of its knowledge \cite{DBLP:books/mit/FHMV1995, alma990002228290206881}. This issue arises in standard epistemic logics and frameworks like BDI because it is unclear how to align the computational implementations of an agent with its knowledge. \cite{DBLP:conf/mallow/AlechinaL10} This misalignment results in the semantics of epistemic logics, lacking the property of being \emph{computationally grounded}. The concept of computationally grounded semantics will be discussed in detail further. \par
